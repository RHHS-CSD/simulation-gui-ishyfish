Predators:
    - Predators (printed as O's) survive by eating prey (P's) 
    - Predators die and are removed from the grid if they haven't eaten any prey 
      for more than 10 turns
    - Predators move by first checking its 4 adjacent cells for prey. If there 
      are prey, predators move towards a random prey and eat it. If there 
      aren't any prey, the predator moves to an empty space if available and 
      its counter for the number of steps without eating goes up
    - Predators have a 10% chance to reproduce if there are at least 2 spaces 
      around it available and it has eaten in the past 5 steps

Prey:
    - Prey move by moving to available empty spaces. Every time they move to an
      empty space, they eat
    - Prey die and are removed from the grid if a predator moves onto their cell 
      (eaten) or starve by not eating (moving) for more than 3 turns
    - Prey have a 10% chance to reproduce if there are at least 2 spaces around 
      it available

General rules/explanations:
    - A 2D array is used to represent the simulation grid; empty spaces have the 
      value 0, prey have value 1, and predators have value 2
    - On each turn, the program loops through every cell in the 2d array to move the 
      predators/prey. A new grid is created to store new positions of the predators/prey.
      All cells from the new grid are copied to the original grid once everything has moved.
    - Predators and prey can only move one step per turn
    - All predators move first, followed by prey
    - When predators/prey reproduce, a offspring is generated in a random available
      adjacent cell before the predator/prey moves

Differentiation option - environmental factors:
    - Added small bushes that are stored in a separate 2D array of the same size 
      as the original grid to the simulation
    - The bushes allow the small prey to hide inside, out of the predators' vision,
      making it so predators won't sense them even if they are located in adjacent cells
    - Bushes randomly spawn in the beginning of the simulation
    - Empty bushes are printed as 'x', and predators/prey located in a cell with a bush
      are printed with their respective character in lowercase
